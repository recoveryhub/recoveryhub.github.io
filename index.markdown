The Recovery Hub for American Women Writers supports projects recovering the work of women writers by providing digital access to forgotten or neglected texts and/or extending them with network mapping, spatial analysis, multimedia storytelling, innovative contextualization, and the distant reading of massive datasets. The Recovery Hub fosters collaboration, mentorship, and community-building among women working in the digital humanities while seeking feminist and decolonial approaches to the creation, curation, design, sharing, and archiving of digital content. 

Each year The Recovery Hub for American Women Writers provides significant support for two digital projects in their early phases. Projects eligible for support include digital editions of letters, books, short fiction, and other texts as well as experimental projects that explore mapping, visualization, and other content-rich methods. The Hub’s editorial framework is designed to support scholars who want to encode recovered documents using the best technical and sustainability standards but who have limited experience with the digital humanities. 

## Digital Projects
The following list showcases projects—past and present—that have utilized the Hub's editorial framework:
